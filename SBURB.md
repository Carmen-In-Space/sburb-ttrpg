# HOW THE TTRPG WORKS

## Skills
- strength
	- attacks
	- strength-based skill checks
- speed
	- defence
	- movement
	- reflex-based skill checks
- smarts
	- insight
	- alchemizing
	- puzzle-solving
	- knowledge-based skill checks
- soul (aspect powers, consort handling)
	- aspect powers
	- consort handling

Base skill set is 3D4+1D6 (distributed by choice)
To level up your skill die, you'll need to:
- strength: alchemizing new weapons
- speed: alchemizing new clothes
- smarts: acquiring knowledge (asking questions, getting your guide to tell you things, do some sleuthing)
- soul: huge feat of aspect prowess (using powers). god-tiering automatically upgrades the die to a higher one (maybe always rolling with advantage, still needs some upgrading options)


## WHAT THE PLAYERS NEED
To play, you only need a SET OF DICE (these can be digital) and your CHARACTER SHEET. To get this character sheet, you will need to make a CHARACTER.

The character will be THIRTEEN, lives in some place with their GUARDIAN (they can be either dead or alive), and has some ONLINE FRIENDS. Aside from that, the players will need a CHUMHANDLE, a STRIFE SPECIBUS (THIS MAY CHANGE), and a SYLLADEX. Your character is also friends with the other players of this game! Discuss with each other how you know each other, what your messages together look like, etcetera. No need to know the specifics! It's fun to roleplay messages to each other, though. Get to know the other's character as if it were your internet friend.

To fill in this character sheet, you will need to do a few things:
### Take some tests:
You will need to take three tests! These should be taken IN CHARACTER, and the results will be used by the GM for the game! Once you have them, send them to the GM in your private channel. Don't worry about the results, the GM will know what to do with them!

### Stats are also pretty important!
The stats in this game will be quite simple. You have 4 STATS, all of which you are PRETTY TERRIBLE at. There will be ONE exception. You get to choose WHICH ONE. (list stats info)

combat thoughts:
- contested rolls against the enemy (multiple to avoid a loss ? or maybe negative modifier for enemies)
- if the strength stat is double the enemy's (or more) it's an automatic win
- this has to be EASYYYYY. and not at all annoying. bc it Will be a grind so it better be as easy as can be
### Confused about some terms? Don't worry, that's normal!
**Chumhandle:** Your username for the pesterchum messaging client. A chumhandle consists of two words: the first word in all lowercase and the second with a capital letter at the start (example: ectoBiologist). This is something your character has picked out for themselves, and thus represents your character in some way (even if it's only slightly accurate).
**Strife specibus:** The inventory system specifically for weapons. Every character starts with one weapon, based on a weapon type. This type can be as vague or as specific as you want (see the strife deck wiki page for a list of them), and can be altered to represent a broken version of your weapon as you play.
**Sylladex:** Your inventory system. This is based on sorting methods in coding, but does not strictly follow those rules. There are lots of modi available, so you can go ham on the system! The general rule is that it has to be at least slightly inconvenient to use, so choose wisely.

**The GMs:** If there's any questions about your character, or if you are in need of assistance, feel free to reach out to us in your private channel! This is not only your first time playing, but also our first time running this and there might be confusing tidbits, so no worries if you don't understand anything just yet!
