# HOW THE TTRPG WORKS

## Skills
- strength
	- attacks
	- strength-based skill checks
- speed
	- defence
	- movement
	- reflex-based skill checks
- smarts
	- insight
	- alchemizing
	- puzzle-solving
	- knowledge-based skill checks
- soul (aspect powers, consort handling)
	- aspect powers
	- consort handling

Base skill set is 3D4+1D6 (distributed by choice)
To level up your skill die, you'll need to:
- strength: alchemizing new weapons
- speed: alchemizing new clothes
- smarts: acquiring knowledge (asking questions, getting your guide to tell you things, do some sleuthing)
- soul: huge feat of aspect prowess (using powers). god-tiering automatically upgrades the die to a higher one (maybe always rolling with advantage, still needs some upgrading options)


## WHAT THE PLAYERS NEED
okay like all of this down here is based on the old sburb thing so these r going to change



To play, you only need a SET OF DICE (these can be digital) and your CHARACTER SHEET. To get this character sheet, you will need to make a CHARACTER.

The character will be THIRTEEN, lives in some place with their GUARDIAN (they can be either dead or alive), and has some ONLINE FRIENDS. Aside from that, the players will need a CHUMHANDLE, a STRIFE SPECIBUS, and a SYLLADEX. Your character is also friends with the other players of this game! Discuss with each other how you know each other, what your messages together look like, etcetera. No need to know the specifics! It's fun to roleplay messages to each other, though. Get to know the other's character as if it were your internet friend.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/12fl8BqxNr2Sw8v3b565bJX-S8P38HZjdbicU_lM-IcM/edit?usp=sharing This is the character sheet you will need to fill in! To fill it in, please copy the file and add your name to the title. After it's filled in, please send it to your GM in your private channel. Make it editable, since the GM might have to make changes to it later.

To fill in this character sheet, you will need to do a few things:
### Take some tests:
You will need to take three tests! These should be taken IN CHARACTER, and the results will be used by the GM for the game! Once you have them, send them to the GM in your private channel. Don't worry about the results, the GM will know what to do with them!

https://personalitydna.com/ Send the two word result
http://www.humanmetrics.com/personality Send the four letter result. 
http://hs.hiveswap.com/ezodiac/index.php Send the Lunar Sway and Aspect.
### Stats are also pretty important!
The stats for this game will be nearly identical to the D&D 5e stats. The base stats are identical to 5e, and will be determined using the Standard 5E method. To determine your base scores for each of these stats, follow these steps: 
1) Roll 4D6 (four, six-sided dice)
2) Take the highest three values, and add them together. 
3) Rinse and repeat for each stat. 
4) Once you have a total of 6 results, assign them to the appropriate stats for your character. 

Modifiers will be nearly identical to 5E modifiers. These will affect action rolls.
The chart below shows the relationship between base stats and modifiers. This pattern continues in both directions from 10.

![[Pasted image 20231227013219.png]]

Your saves will work slightly differently from 5E. Your character will automatically get a 2+ bonus to two modifiers of their choice, as well as proficiency in up to 4 skills. These are a +2 bonus in things your character is especially good at.

Aside from that, you will get 1D10 of health per level, starting at Level 0 with 10 health. You will also have a base AC (Avoidance Capability) of 10 + your Abscondence modifier. You also have a skill called Luck, which is your Dexterity and Charisma modifier combined. You can use Luck to add points to your rolls if needed. These can be used as much or as little as you like, and will recharge after a long rest.

Strifes (combat) will be turn-based according to the highest collective Initiative of the players and enemies involved. The group with the highest collective roll will get the first turn. During your turn, players each decide their actions in order of their individual initiatives, which will then be taken simultaneously. This allows for combo-attacks, assists, and other collaborative actions.

Once you reach 0HP, you can roll a Struggle Save once per turn to see if you get out of danger or if you fall unconscious. This is a straight D20 roll. A 10 or higher is a Success and a 9 or below is a Fail. At three Successes, you make it out of the situation with 1HP. At three Fails, you will fall unconscious until you are either healed, or until a long rest has passed. Allies are able to heal you during their turns, but some more powerful or intelligent enemies might decide to finish you off, so be careful when fighting!
### Confused about some terms? Don't worry, that's normal!
**Chumhandle:** Your username for the pesterchum messaging client. A chumhandle consists of two words: the first word in all lowercase and the second with a capital letter at the start (example: ectoBiologist). This is something your character has picked out for themselves, and thus represents your character in some way (even if it's only slightly accurate).
**Strife specibus:** The inventory system specifically for weapons. Every character starts with one weapon, based on a weapon type. This type can be as vague or as specific as you want (see the strife deck wiki page for a list of them), and can be altered to represent a broken version of your weapon as you play.
**Sylladex:** Your inventory system. This is based on sorting methods in coding, but does not strictly follow those rules. There are lots of modi available, so you can go ham on the system! The general rule is that it has to be at least slightly inconvenient to use, so choose wisely.

**The GM:** If there's any questions about your character, or if you are in need of assistance, feel free to reach out to me in your private channel! This is not only your first time playing, but also my first time running this, so there might be confusing tidbits, so no worries if you don't understand anything just yet!
