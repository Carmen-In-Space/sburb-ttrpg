A SBURB player's assigned title consists of 2 parts—the [[Aspect|aspect]], and the class, the latter indicating the intended role of the player, and how they may use their aspect. There are 14 known classes, consisting of 12 "normal" classes and two "master" classes. Only the normal classes are listed here.

Each class consists of pair of passive (+) and active (-) classes. They have the same core elements, but use their powers differently. Simplistically, active means self-serving while passive means group oriented. Active classes employ or affect their aspect directly and for their own gain, and passive classes are affected _by_ their aspect, and work to benefit their team.
